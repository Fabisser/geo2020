    the number of floors of a building is an important factor when assessing the built
    environment. Building floor count can help with a wide range of subjects such
    as building energy demand models, flood response plans, housing market studies
    and so on. The problem is that there is no global (open) dataset containing this
    information. Examples of datasets that could contain building floor count information
    (implicitly), are point clouds or cadastral data. These are expensive, infrequently
    updated, and/or closed. Instead, pictures are a relatively inexpensive, easily
    updateable and available data source, existing already at large scale (eg Google
    Street View, Mapillary).

    However, although inferring higher lever semantics (eg building floor count) from
    images is trivial for a human, for a machine it is not. Prior work has been done
    on successfully extracting lower level building semantics (eg doors, windows,
    balconies) from images with a deep convolutional neural network. The objective
    is to extend this research and develop an end-to-end pipeline to accurately determine
    the building floor count from lower level semantics. How should the semantics
    (eg windows) be processed further? What type of spatial clustering is most effective
    in building floor count? What (pre)processing techniques increase the performance
    of the proposed method? These are initial questions that arise in solving accurate
    building floor count determination with deep learning.', b575ce82525b-thesis_p1.jpg]
Dong: [Haoyang, Maarten Pronk, Hugo Ledoux, "Accurate elevation data are essential\
