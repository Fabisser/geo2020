Edward Verbree,Dr. Akkelies van Nes,,"While most concepts related to localisation and navigation of outdoors environments are already pretty well derived from various researches, mechanisms and softwares / Applications, the indoor environment remains a significantly unexplored area. Although there are already some methods available for the indoor localisation, this MSc-thesis main objective will be to explore a new one and provide an initial investigation on how the Isovist, visibility graphs and Space syntax concepts can work together to deliver a new method and solution for localisation and possibly route planning/navigation on indoor environments. The questions that need to be answered are “To what extent can isovist support Indoor Localisation”, “How to create an Isovist fingerprinting to a radio map” and “Is it possible to make it usable as a user app”.
The “tools” which will be used in order to answer the forementioned research questions will be some existing Isovist Software like “www.isovists.org” or some other software for space syntax calculations and the necessary programming languages (e.g. Python, JavaScript) in order to check if the integration between the available software and data is possible. The creation or use of a Sight map will be also necessary as well some experiments on a test area (Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment of TU Delft).

Its unique advantages make it well fit the demand for point clouds data in many urban scenes. So in recent years, MLS has been widely used in many urban applications such as urban environment monitoring, digital 3D urban modeling, and high-definition maps for self-driving vehicles. Most of the above applications usually focus only on static environment objects, like the ground surface, buildings, trees, etc. However, MLS data often inevitably includes many dynamic objects, such as moving vehicles, which may seriously interfere with these mentioned point cloud applications.
Due to this issue, this thesis project aims at solving two research tasks: The first task is designing a method to detect dynamic objects in the MLS dataset. This phase focuses on the correctness of detection, including avoiding marking static objects as dynamic objects and missing any dynamic objects in the results. Then the second task is the removal of these avoiding detected dynamic objects from the original MLS dataset. The key at this stage is to remove the dynamic object intact, otherwise, it will leave many outliers in the result, and to avoid removing parts of the static environment. 
The research will be conducted in collaboration with CycloMedia Technology.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/fef912c1ad47458c724b92b790cbec269d5e2536b5ad26d077ccd366be7484e2/dynamic_objs.gif,2022-01-24T00:00:00.000Z,10:45-11:45,2021-11-12 14:11:54,2021-11-12 18:25:36,c73028f80e

This platform can then be used by different professionals involved in the process of urban planning to take effective and well-informed decisions for the cities. In addition to usage of such platforms for the purpose of visualisation, one could also implement or develop the platform to be used as a scenario analysis platform. Recently, OGC has developed a 3D Tile standard for streaming and rendering massive 3D geospatial data, which would be used for visualisation of the 3D city models on the platform. The platform should be able to run user-interactive simulations on the city model (like neighbourhood development, or traffic simulations) and make the visualizations possible. It would be developed in a gaming engine, e.g. Unreal Engine, which allows to make immersive experience for the end-user (by using VR or AR). Would be useful for public participation or decision making.
The research will hence focus on the creation of the OGC 3D tiling technique based scenario analysis platform for digital twins with the following objectives:
1.	To run urban simulations on the developed platform
2.	To test the performance of the developed platform with different LoD buildings
3.	To enable user interaction in the platform for neighbourhood development

p0kfp5g286ottvjtwtgprc5p0kfp5g2p,Haoyang,Dong,5302501,Snap rounding in a triangulation,Hugo Ledoux,Ken Arroyo Ohori,,"Snap rounding (SR) is an approach to robust computing by converting arbitrary-precision segment arrangements into fixed-precision representations. A widely used implementation of it is iterated snap rounding (ISR). ISR guarantees that no vertices are closer with any non-incident edges than a threshold; therefore, it can be used to improve the robustness of polygons. However, it may change the topology significantly; for example, it may make a polygon with a hole two separate polygons. Furthermore, ISR is computationally expensive for big sets of polygons, like planar partitions. Recent studies on SR or ISR mostly focus on applications in 3D or reducing the problematic outputs of ISR. Few pieces of research are done on improving SR or implementing SR in other ways, which is essential for multiple uses. Previous work has demonstrated the efficiency and reliability of a constrained-triangulation-based method to repair a single polygon (prepair) or planar partitions (pprepair). In this project, we aim to build a triangulation-based snapping round method so that both the validity and robustness of polygons can be guaranteed.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/e1be0fddbefce97746b806f9dce43e7fc375fe4cb3cbc45e045e24f4f59f5be2/unknown.png,2022-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,15:00,2021-11-12 14:10:52,2021-11-12 15:46:15,35bb5bdce9

One of the challenges in completing the production is in terms of funding. Currently, the production of the data is dependent to the state-budget with amount of 12 to 15 million US dollar per year been allocated, this budget constraint is not sufficient to fulfill the ambition to accomplish the data production. Several foreign aid, such as grant or loans, already been implemented but this type of funding is mostly attached to other big-scale project and have small amount of budget. Another initiative is Public-Private Partnership (PPP), but PPP is a well-known funding type for civil infrastructure and very few use it in funding spatial data production. One example of PPP is in Norway with the Norge Digitalt (ND) project. While in South Korea, the co-funding model between central and local government is implemented to produce large-scale map. Nevertheless, each of the funding model have consequences and may lead to less accessible data by the citizen in terms of return on investment of production cost. This contradicts to open government initiatives, where the data produce by the government, including spatial data, should be freely accessible to the citizen.

For example, structure-aware generative model of 3D urban geometry and texture are becoming increasingly useful in graphics and virtual world. Labeled parts of buildings can also facilitate a variety of analyses of buildings. However, it’s challenging to obtain correct part labels for widely available 3D models of buildings in the form of dense triangle meshes. The annotation work is time-consuming and costly, and inexperienced human workers can easily mislabel specific parts, such as domes or buttresses. This thesis aims to transfer building part labels from existing CAD models of buildings (i.e., BuildingNet) to the SUM dataset based on the theory of domain adaptation. Our goal is to generate a part-level building segmentation dataset. The labeled 3D building models in BuildingNet will be used as the source domain and building models in the SUM will be the target domain. The source and target domains all have the same feature space but different representations of geometry.

The difficulty often lies in the information on these two types of spaces being sourced and stored differently. And the existence of semi-indoor (top-bounded) and semi-outdoor (side-bounded) spaces, only serves to further complicate the matter.

While there is valuable research on unifying these spaces and integrating different data types, there seems to be little focus on the users themselves. Even if seamless navigation is attained, it means little if the user does not understand the types of environment that the application is trying to convey, or cannot see what form of accessibility the space has. For example, a user being told that there is a door leading to an indoor space is of little use if that user is restricted by the width of a wheelchair or a pushchair, or if that door is for private use only. This thesis will be exploring how the transitions between (semi-) indoor-outdoor spaces can be intuitively visualised for clear communication to the user, with prototype visualisations undergoing user testing and evaluation.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/03339082734ad35101a5965757ccde615c692ff3683c783ffad6f1ae1cd74967/Screenshot_2021_11_12_at_13.01.07.png,0022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z,Morning,2021-11-12 11:27:23,2021-11-12 12:04:32,a1b7a9fedf

segmentation, classification, and reconstruction of both indoor and outdoor 3D models of the
built environment. In my thesis, I would further like to explore the possibility of using a
semantically enriched voxelised space as a basis for evacuation management.
The starting point for this research will be a voxelised space of a building that has been enriched with semantics and, more importantly, it's known which parts of the building are navigable buildings and which aren't. This voxelised space will most likely have to be manually edited to be able to accept input from equipment used in building safety management and fire suppression systems, such as smoke sensors and manual call points, and be able to generate output such as routes and signage. This leaves me with a framework in which to develop an algorithm that will find the best evacuation routes for all users of that building in a dynamic emergency situation.

This means diving into routing/pathfinding algorithms, and applying this to the voxelised space. Apart from pathfinding, and the added complexity of the dynamic setting, I would focus on how this information is to be visualised for the users/managers of the building.

The goal of this thesis project is to retrieve building heights from ICESat-2 and evaluate the accuracy with the data from 3D BAG. And due to the tracks are far away with each other, the first thing needs to do is to assess how many buildings in NL are covered. For those are uncovered, the Machine Learning method combined with features from footprints will be used based on previous work. These features can be classified as building geometries, neighborhood, city types, etc. This thesis will first focus on a small area, then extends to the whole Netherlands.

The current state includes two Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) assessing the roof geometrical potential for PV installation. The first network segments a roof into 16 azimuth classes; the second detects installations on the roof, called “superstructures”, as single- or multi-classes (ladder, chimney…). The wider pipeline considers the physical suitability of roofs, as well as the technical and economical potentials for PV installation.
 
The motivation of the thesis is to improve the geometrical potential assessment of roofs by extending the existing network(s) with 3D data. Despite little research conducted on CNN for RGB-Height (Z) data, it has recently been established that Z information added to a CNN can improve the accuracy for classifying aerial imagery. 

Based on these results and the existing work at the chair, we will explore the following question: 
How can 3D data be best integrated into a CNN for RGB aerial images to improve the semantic segmentation of roof superstructures on buildings?

These simulations and analysis have become essential tools for decision making in urban planning and analytics.
 
High data quality 3D city models serve as reliable representation of the real world objects, seeing the high-quality information and solid spatial visibility they offer. To validate the quality of the date and achieve interoperability, the ISO 19100 series standards were created. But there are just too many different fields where 3D data can be exploited to conclude all validation rules for every field. For example typical extra requirements for wind simulation software include: no small features, edges, and gaps between buildings.  Sadly a significant amount of 3D city models is not considered valid to the standards above. This hinders the further analyzing or processing of these models. Since manual repair of 3D City models is very time consuming and prone to errors, automatic repair methods are highly desirable. Therefore the objective of this thesis will be to develop a software framework as proof-of-concept for automatic repair of 3D city models.

One of these enhancing methods is the use of synthetic training images, which refer to simulated aerial imagery taken from a virtual world. Compared to real imagery data, synthetic images have several significant advantages, such as simulating different conditions (e.g., lighting, camera positions) and lowering production costs.

Consequently, this thesis aims to create a benchmark to produce synthetic data for aerial image segmentation. We will develop artificial cities with procedural architecture techniques to simulate real-world cities. We will build a tool using existing computer vision techniques to produce training images with pixel-wise semantic segmentation. With the produced synthetic images, we will train a deep learning model to perform semantic segmentation over real-world images (with techniques such as domain adaptation). We will also incorporate features of 3D building to enhance the model further. In the end, the performance of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and mIoU (mean Intersection over Union).",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/ec614679dcc577b07b61246be22574175a262c7a81a1b0f124e537156b23d68a/CamiloCaceresImageThesis.jpg,2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z,2:00 pm,2021-11-12 08:34:20,2021-11-12 08:46:09,ea3948ebf5

Landmarks such as high-rise buildings, are of high importance for the users’ guidance in the outdoor environment. Additionally, landmarks can also be used as an affirmation that the user is on the correct route. Concerning indoor landmarks, their lower density and the absence of outstanding elements, may result to easier loss of orientation compared to outdoors. Localisation, combined with an indoor network, can provide information on the current and previous locations of a user. Therefore, localisation may be used in case of emergencies, such as fires, where a civilian has to describe his location to the fire authorities. Consequently, indoor landmarks can be used to transmit this information. 
This thesis will investigate the reliability of ceilings as indoor landmarks in terms of user guidance. Image matching techniques will be used, based on captured images of the ceilings, which are distinguishable in public buildings due to the existing installations. The users will be able to compare their own image, with an existing collection of images, in order to localise themselves. In addition, this research will involve finding the optimal image-matching algorithm for this scenario, as well as the most used paths, based on the locations that users were traced, at a certain time period.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/ff4441e5480189faa37c4f7406db26ab2d9fdc6aab2014d9291393f9033e7109/p1.png,2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z,,2021-11-12 08:01:18,2021-11-12 08:10:24,38b3b790de

Sediment discharge enters the canal's reservoirs by means of several rivers. This sediment then settles and consequently raises the bed level and decreases the total storage capacity. This process, called sedimentation, limits the lifespan of all reservoirs and is a large threat to the future of the canal. 
Broad approximations of the accumulated sediment in the Alhajuela reservoir up until now have been made, but more insight is required since the amount of time until the canal will no longer have sufficient water to operate is still unknown. With a more accurate prediction of the amount and location of future sedimentation, a timeframe for finding an alternative water source can be established and dredging operations can be better engineered which will then temporarily slow the decrease in reservoir storage capacity. 
The objective of this research project is to provide insight into this problem by first obtaining a set of geo-morphometric and hydrological features from historical elevation data and basic hydrological information. These features, e.g. annual average change in bed elevation, distance from the river mouth, and annual river discharge are then used to predict local bed level changes in the Alhajuela Reservoir as a result of sedimentation, using a machine learning algorithm.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/3f669246033e9dcfc76fd600ff48102c85dd8b20f0ce49f58f3437dafb761b14/Alhajuela.png,2022-01-27T00:00:00.000Z,afternoon,2021-11-11 22:31:05,2021-11-11 22:55:43,1bcc20a3ba

QGIS is going to be used as a  front-end user-friendly environment, while the complex relational database queries are being handled by the back-end at database server level.

Currently, the 3DCityDB database schema is composed of a circa 60 tables that are used to map the CityGML data model. For a “normal” user, these interconnected tables are hard to handle even for simple operations like performing queries over multiple tables or setting the color of a feature.
The envisioned plugin will enable city data practitioners (users/organisations) with limited experience with RDBMS or with the CityGML model to access, explore and use the data in a simpler way.
Given the relevance of CityGML as an international standard for urban data (and applications based on it) improving its accessibility will be very beneficial for the users’ community.

This thesis will develop a prototype QGIS plugin which will focus mainly on the Building features, but that will be open to further extension for the remaining CityGML modules (bridges, waterbodies, etc.). More specifically, it will be based on  CityGML v. 2.0, the 3DCityDB for PostgreSQL/PostGIS and QGIS LTR 3.22.
The intended functionalities are to allow the user to connect, load, edit features attributes, and update the database using the QGIS plugin.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/e2447565415ed484256080d52635c028e3bab75aeea50215dcb31b9d214c66d7/3DCityDB400x200.png,2022-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,10:00 AM,2021-11-11 16:27:59,2021-11-11 21:57:20,3058540ac7

However, estimating real-life tree growth is a difficult process due to the large number of factors influencing the growth process, the inherent complexity of plant growth and architecture, and the frequent need for prior botanical knowledge and/or accurate multi-temporal field data. This thesis will balance accuracy, processing speed, and botanical, spatial and environmental soundness to generate tree models as realistic as possible using synthetic multi-temporal LiDAR data of same-species trees. Tree growth time series will be synthesized using same-species data of trees at different growth stages, of which an average model will be generated with joint geometric and structural blending in a 3D tree shape-space per growth cycle. Inverse procedural modelling will be used to infer tree growth at branch level, taking into account detailed biological knowledge. The tree growth models will be validated using LiDAR time-series data and a validation algorithm measuring geometric, structural, and topological distance. The validated growth model will then be used to predict future plant growth in urban scenarios as well as interpolate past growth stages for which no ground-truth data exists.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/c7e334feb1e75b5221eaf27cf78b2382b3b9424b583b8382f1c32c0779401ee0/GEO2020_P1_image_400x400.png,0021-01-18T00:00:00.000Z,15:45-16:45,2021-11-11 18:45:17,2021-11-11 18:48:21,45e7384561

Specifically, the needs of the modern smart cities, for analysis and simulation of their urban environment, make the existence of precise and comprehensive knowledge about their 3D space necessary. However, this information is limited, mainly, to above-ground applications while the existing underground assets lack detailed information and mapping. Additionally, generally underground information available is provided only in 2D and, usually, that data are incomplete or imprecise, as - for example - there is no direct connection between above- and below-ground infrastructures. Taking into account the immediate dependencies of the above-ground applications with the underground utility networks it is crucial to have a more accurate and integrated representation of supply networks. Having this goal as a starting point, the main research questions addressed by this thesis will be:
""How is it possible to model utility networks in 3D, integrated with the above-ground objects, such that they can be suitable for multiple uses?"", 
""How to represent a direct connection with the above-ground condition?”.  
The thesis will focus on creating a 3D geo-referenced map of a subset of existing utility networks (e.g. sewage) in an area of the TU campus, observing their current condition, and proposing a strategy to harmonize and integrate the existing information.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/0be9cf652029f7833635a8b6535ee19951ade66b9ca80c5a39973f72222754b0/Thesis_image.jpg,2022-01-20T00:00:00.000Z,16:00,2021-11-11 08:23:30,2021-11-11 09:06:48,9c5cbda313

CitySim is an open-source simulation software to perform different energy simulations for buildings/districts (e.g. space heating energy demand, solar irradiation, urban heat islands). The 3D City Database (3DCityDB) is the reference database for CityGML data (and its Energy ADE extension) where input AND output data can be stored. Currently, these three elements are not well connected, resulting in relatively complex operations for data retrieval, simulation, and storage for energy simulations.

The major goal of this tool will be helping the user to get details about these three building elements in a simple, quick and reliable manner so that it can be used for not only the final assessment, but also as a quick intermediate evaluation that can be executed during the design process. Thus, it will not only become an assessment tool, but also a possible design tool. 
The focus will lie on the development of this tool to allow it to function on models that are not optimally made. In practice used IFC models are often non-standard, faulty or both. This could be due to (but is not limited by) the different practices by users/firms, the different used software packages to create the models (AutoDesk Revit, Graphisoft Archicad or IFCBlender), the fairly complex IFC standard and normal user errors. To decrease the influence of these errors the tool will rely minimally on the (by the user) set data fields of the present geometric objects.

Both BIM and GIS are capable in modelling cities and buildings, however, the translation from one to the other is not as straightforward as one might expect.

CityGML Energy ADE is one of these data models that allows the storage of energy-related data of buildings, which can then be used in simulation tools in both input and output sides. While this data model is already highly used with an XML-based encoding, an equivalent extension is not yet provided for CityJSON. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the development and testing of an Energy Extension for CityJSON so that energy-related data can be stored. The first part of the thesis will consist of determining design principles since a direct mapping from Energy ADE to a CityJSON Extension may not be possible. Similarities and differences between an XML-based and JSON-based format will be considered, and any missing information in the Energy ADE will be investigated to be included in the CityJSON Extension. Moreover, certain tests will be carried out throughout the design process to validate the extension implementation. These tests will include geometrical calculations to retrieve semantic information of buildings which will then be stored in the CityJSON + Energy Extension file.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/2a356cf57e3d5cacde90343ce71cd5a58285957152d5d15ef1542df983c914ce/P1_image_final.jpg,2022-01-25T00:00:00.000Z,14:45,2021-10-27 13:20:29,2021-10-27 13:30:55,ab92dcbafd

This would be beneficial for several reasons. For one thing, users would not have to install anything besides a web browser. This way, tools can be shared, cross-platorm, without having to download or build anything. Secondly, client-side geoprocessing can make geoprocessing more interactive and insightful. A 'sandbox environment' which can do geodata _retrieval_, _processing_, and _visualization_ from a web browser would be a great tool for debugging, quickly looking at the effects of parameters, and finding out which algorithms work best with which dataset.

This research attempts to solve two barriers preventing successful client-side geoprocessing. The first barrier is that the client-side programming language `javascript`, together with its library ecosystem, do not offer the speed nor the tools to perform fast geoprocessing. To solve this, WebAssembly, a type of binary that runs in virtual machines, will be considered. It can be used to take an existing C++ geoprocessing library (like _cgal_), and to publish it in a way anyone with a browser can run it at near native speed. 

The second barrier is that an application using 'just WebAssembly' will not be very useful or insightful without a sufficient framework supporting it. This thesis will consider a framework in the form of a web-based Visual Programming Language, or VPL to facilitate this.",https://api.typeform.com/responses/files/728fd9ef3d157375b38e8a265d7bb4d27a15d08530dd49ce0e9058ff74d46c83/thumbnail_1.png,2022-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,15:45 - 16:45 (to make sure Ken can attend from Mexico),2021-09-24 08:47:24,2021-09-24 09:06:21,cfab853daa
