[Arup](https://www.arup.com/) is an an independent firm of consultants, engineers and designers, who constantly develop 
ideas and techniques to improve the environment of people. 

We seek to provide a hands-on environment and a support network for technical specialists and engineers in training. 
Possible research topics are listed below, but feel free to approach Kotryna Valeckaite(Kotryna.Valeckaite@arup.com) our 
recruitment department (recruitmentnl@arup.com) with your own ideas.

# Building systems
## Communication protocols for building mechanical systems
Communication is the glue in the Internet of Things. It is also the least visible and understood. Current developments in the building sector are mostly driven by hardware vendors and are usually targeted at refitting systems in existing buildings. Communication often is an afterthought and more or less taken for granted. The primary aim of the project is to develop a method to interface with the ventilation dampers, allowing us to monitor and control them, given user comfort requirements. We strive to build a testing environment for different communication protocols, allowing us to interface with MEP systems and connect them to the advanced simulations running to predict the behavior of the building system (Digital Twins & energy transition theme). The tool will provide insight into hardware and software requirements for the communication to work. A second aim is to link the data obtained from the ‘Things’ to a database for visualization and potential post processing.

# Urban insight
## Urban infrastructure optioneering
The CETT and Infrastructure team are currently working on projects for the Dutch Government where we have been asked to design, evaluate and advise on civil structural options and their respective alignments and impact on the urban fabric.

In this project we are looking to evaluate the position of bicycle bridges (or tunnels), for the IJ-crossing in Amsterdam. Currently, it is still a subject of a heated debate between local and national government bodies and large private entities because of a conflict of interests. The idea is to make something that gives (real-time) a quick insight into different relevant parameters (position, horizontal and vertical alignments, clearances, ways of connecting to the bicycle network, costs, economic value-losses, etc.). Ideally it should be something that: * objectively assesses as many elements of the discussion as possible; * shows real-time visually the implications of certain options, making the discussions easier, leaving “only” a political choice.

# Environmental modelling
The CETT team in Arup does frequently participate in multidisciplinary design competitions in the very early design stages. This has led the team to build a parametric toolbox for early stage massing optimization (in Grasshopper/Rhino) which allows to reuse analysis modules across multiple projects. The toolbox currently contains modules for sun, view, daylight and acoustic analysis. A frequently requested addition to the toolbox would be an Urban Heat Island (UHI) assessment module. The goal of this project is to build a UHI assessment module in Grasshopper/Rhino that plugs into the optimization system. It would inform designers on how geometric/physical parameters in the built environment can influence the UHI effect. This could be done in collaboration with the Geomatics thesis topic ‘Interaction between urban heat islands and semantic 3D city models’ supervised by Giorgio Agugiaro and Alexander Wandl.

# Energy transition
Most countries are transitioning to low carbon energy systems. The Dutch government understands the challenge and is acting decisively on the decarbonization and fuel poverty agendas. The aim of this project is to create an interactive web tool which would help Dutch municipalities identify the most effective measures that meet climate goals for the built environment. The tool should bring together available data from public sources and use it to draw insights that can inform a cities’ energy transition plan. It should give insight into the effects of carbon emissions, and draw relationships between proposed interventions, policies, and redevelopment scenarios. 
The tool should be designed in a modular way so that different plugins can be linked (eg. energy simulation, financial analysis...) to cater the needs of different cities.

# Building stock classification
## 3D modelling
Point clouds are one of the core data sources used for environmental analysis (e.g. urban heat island, flood risk, illumination). Many of these types of analyses require 3D models with well-defined roof shapes or Level of Detail 2 (LoD2) models. The reconstruction of such models is still predominantly manual, whilst lower detail LoD1 models (extruded boxes) still require specialist software or extensive pre-processing. 
The aim of the project is to evaluate and apply state-of-the-art algorithms for processing regional scale 3D point cloud data and automatically generating 3D building models. This project would be the first step towards a software agnostic cloud-based service, allowing end-users to seamlessly and efficiently integrate 3D context data into their work.

# Image Recognition
The research team been working in a large building stock data analysis project in Amsterdam for multiple years. A recurrent need for assessing the resilience of the building stock has been the identification of openings and opening percentages. During this project a large amount of streetview images have been processed and labeled, and could therefore be used as a learning set for machine learning processes. An automated workflow is now increasingly possible through Machine Learning image recognition algorithms, using existing learning datasets (e.g. as the ones recently released by Google) and images labeled by the research team.
The aim of this research is to do an initial investigation of new possibilities in the automatic identification and localization of openings, given external streetview imagery - in order to produce opening percentage & layout data for existing building stock subsets using an available labelled dataset
