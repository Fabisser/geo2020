#### Some useful links

- [SharePoint system of BK for the progress and grades, aka The System](https://teams.connect.tudelft.nl/sites/BK/OS/graduationregistration/Lists/Polls/AllItems.aspx)
- [Rubric_Geomatics.pdf for marking](../rules/Rubric_Geomatics.pdf)


#### What you have to do for each P

##### P1 

  - 1st supervisor must be there for her student(s). 2nd can be there but not mandatory
  - nothing else to do

##### P2

  - Both supervisors must attend P2
  - 1st supervisor must put in The System the final result of P2 (go/nogo/retake)

##### P3

  - attend the presentation
  - the student has to organise it, not you
  - 1st supervisor must put in The System that P3 has been done

##### P4

  - both supervisors must read carefully the draft and ensure that the student has a chance to pass. You're wasting everyone's time if you know you'll give a nogo and still have the P4.
  - attend P4
  - 1st supervisor must put in The System the result of P4    

##### P5
  
  - attend P5
  - grade the student with [the rubric](../rules/Rubric_Geomatics.pdf)
  - make a speech in front of the family and friends
  - smile a lot while doing this
  - 1st supervisor must put the final grade in The System
