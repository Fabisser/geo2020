## What if I can't be there at one P?
Read p.18 of the [Official Graduation Manual 2018-2019](../rules/GraduationManualGeomatics2018-2019.pdf).

## What you have to do for each P

### P1 

  - nothing to do

### P2

  - both supervisors should read P2 proposal
  - both supervisors must attend P2, and ask questions
  - both supervisors decide if it's a go or nogo
  - 1st supervisor must put in The System the final result of P2 (go/nogo/retake)

### P3

  - between P2 and P4, one meeting should be discussing the progress of the student
  - feedback must be given, with tips to improve
  - P3 should be clicked as done in The System by 1st supervisor

### P4

  - before P4 a co-reader must be chosen
  - the co-reader can, if they want, read the draft version and those comments be given to the student at the P4. *But it is not mandatory*, the co-reader task is at P5 officially.
  - both supervisors must read carefully the draft and ensure that the student has a chance to pass. You're wasting everyone's time if you know you'll give a nogo and still have the P4.
  - you have to assess if the work is original, and thus you need to go to the [Brightspace Plagiarism Scan thingy](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/home/47493) and check the report. ([Full details here](../rules/Nieuw_Teacher_mail_V4.docx)).
  - both supervisors must attend P4
  - 1st supervisor must put in The System the result of P4    

### P5
  
  - you have to assess if the work is original, and thus you need to go to the [Brightspace Plagiarism Scan thingy](https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/home/47493) and check the report. ([Full details here](../rules/Nieuw_Teacher_mail_V4.docx)).
  - both supervisors must attend P5, and the co-reader, and ask questions
  - grade the student with [the rubric](../rubric/)
  - make a speech in front of family and friends
  - smile a lot while doing this
  - 1st supervisor must put the final grade in The System
