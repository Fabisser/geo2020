- 'ISO 19650 part-1 and part-2 present attractive solutions for managing information
  on project-based work that include BIM data.

  The usage of BIM data in combination with GIS data is important for large-scale
  work such as infrastructure projects. The spatial context enables deeper insight
  for better decision-making, communication, and understanding. Furthermore, having
  GIS/BIM data shared on the web enables easier sharing and exchanging of data.

  ISO 19650-1:2018 contains the concept of a Common Data Environment (CDE), and defines
  it as "agreed source of information for any given project or asset, for collecting,
  managing, and disseminating each information container through a managed process.
  A CDE workflow describes the process to be used and a CDE solution might provide
  the technology to support those processes". The definition of a CDE covers both
  the process for collecting, managing and disseminating information and the technological
  solutions that support this process.

  This thesis studies what information management standards are in ISO 19650-1:2018
  and ISO 19650-2:2018. Furthermore, it investigates the possibility of implementing
  a common data environment and applying these standards for projects based on WebGIS
  platforms and Webservices as an exchange data format.'

- "The main goal of this research is to improve the automated generalization process\
  \ for vario-scale maps at non-fixed levels of detail (stored with the tGAP data\
  \ structure). Traditionally, the content for vario-scale maps has been created using\
  \ a \u2018one fits all\u2019 approach equal for all scales. Due to this fact, currently\
  \ available vario-scale maps are often not well-tuned, and thus can generate an\
  \ undesired result.\nThis graduation project will look at the various pieces of\
  \ puzzle which constitute a good and adaptive vario-scale map, such as the aggregation\
  \ of non-direct neighbors, how the generalization operators are orchestrated, line\
  \ simplification analysis and how linear features are treated, among others, and\
  \ will try to showcase how these fit together in the overall vario-scale algorithm.\n\
  A thorough research on these elements shall be conducted, and presented alongside\
  \ a demo web application, showcasing the analysis."

- "In the Global South, large urban spaces resulted in the duality \u2018formal\u2019\
  \ and \u2018informal\u2019 cities. It\u2019s the case of Sao Paulo, a 22M ppl. metropolis\
  \ and a financial hub in Latin America. Albeit a vast literature addresses the social-spatial\
  \ segregation emerging from this dual built environment, the scarcity of spatial\
  \ datasets regarding informal settlements also enforces a geo-information segregation,\
  \ resulting in a terra incognita. This is exemplar in favelas, defined as precarious,\
  \ spontaneous and unorganised land occupation built on third-party property, most\
  \ of which lack cadastral data. As favelas are often not mapped, assessing urban\
  \ phenomena becomes a technical challenge for several application domains, e.g.\
  \ the energy one. Recent public initiatives in Brazil estimate solar irradiation\
  \ and photovoltaic potential for buildings at city scale, but favelas are intentionally\
  \ excluded from the resulting web-based solar maps. Technicians believe that the\
  \ absence of a spatial pattern in favelas calls for investigation on how to refine\
  \ a roof mapping methodology. The research questions thus become 1) How far is it\
  \ possible to perform solar analysis in buildings of favelas in Sao Paulo with the\
  \ goal of estimating PV potential? 2) What are the min. required geodata to map\
  \ buildings (roofs) in a favela, and can a specific methodology be set up? 3) What\
  \ are the requirements, level of applicability and type of results (e.g. accuracy)\
  \ delivered by different existing irradiation models?"

- "Solar energy is an important type of renewable energy. Building roofs are very\
  \ suitable to install solar panels used for generating solar energy. However, not\
  \ every roof is as suitable as another roof. Therefore, to optimize where solar\
  \ panels should be placed, and to estimate the solar potential of a given area,\
  \ one can model solar irradiation by taking into account all the factors influencing\
  \ the solar potential of a building.\nCurrently, most of the methods are using as\
  \ input raster data, such as digital elevation models (DEMs). However, more and\
  \ more 3D vector models of urban regions are available, for instance the 3D BAG.\
  \ Efficient algorithms using those 3D vector data as input are not widely available\
  \ and implemented yet. \nThis thesis will focus on developing a methodology, and\
  \ implementing it, that takes (a part of) the 3D BAG dataset as input to calculate\
  \ the solar irradiation of every building included in the dataset. To perform this,\
  \ at least the following factors will be considered:\n-\tThe position of the sun\
  \ for varying time at the respective building position;\n-\tSlope and aspect of\
  \ the faces of a building;\n-\tObstructions by surrounding buildings (and potentially\
  \ for trees, if time allows it).\nMethods considering voxels and ray tracing are\
  \ likely to be suitable for modelling solar irradiation for vector data. It is essential\
  \ that the newly developed method, making use of existing methods and software packages,\
  \ has a relatively high performance for large datasets."

- "The majority of existing Land Administration Systems (LASs) around the world are\
  \ based on 2D systems where a 2D parcel/spatial unit is the key-entity of property\
  \ registration. Those systems are supported by processes that are designed for 2D\
  \ parcel representation in digital format and are often still implemented using\
  \ paper-based records. In order to cope with the societal trends, such as urbanisation,\
  \ societal disparities, and the digital transformation, those systems need re-engineering\
  \ to extend into 3D. \n\nThe use of 3D objects in LASs occurs when the Rights, Restrictions\
  \ and Responsibilities (RRRs) are linked to the volume of a 2D parcel.  2D parcels\
  \ do not adequately support the use of 3D objects below and above the surface. It\
  \ is not always clear who owns the objects below the surface. How the objects above\
  \ and below the surface are connected is often not known. Using a 3D LAS can make\
  \ registering and visualisation of RRRs less complicated and will lead to several\
  \ benefits such as improving and assisting in the decision making in urban development.\
  \ \n\nThere is however no standardised workflow on how to collect, process, store,\
  \ visualise, disseminate and query 3D underground data in a 3D LAS and model the\
  \ relations between underground and above-ground objects.  \n\nThe objective of\
  \ this research is defined by the research question formed below: \n\nHow can 3D\
  \ underground objects be modelled in a 3D Land Administration System and connected\
  \ to above-ground objects?"

- 'It is generally assumed that higher level of detail results in higher accuracy
  of the output. However, it comes at a cost, more detail yields larger files and
  growing computational times. When modelling noise, the influence of terrain details
  on the noise propagation depends on the local shape and characteristics. Therefore
  the output accuracy does not only depend on the general level of detail, but also
  on the local detail in shapes that influence the noise propagation most.


  The aim of this research is to identify the influence of landscape characteristics
  on noise propagation and develop a product to automatically construct a TIN holding
  semantic information and buildings information for noise modelling purposes.'
