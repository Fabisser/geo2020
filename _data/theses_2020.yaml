- "Nowadays, 3D semantic city models are more and more used for the analysis of large\
  \ urban areas. Until now, the focus has mostly been on models of buildings that\
  \ have become very common. Nonetheless, many cases that could benefit from the detailed\
  \ geometrical and semantic representation of road networks as well (Beil, Christof\
  \ & Kolbe, Thomas, 2017). Nevertheless, the representation of roads in 3D city models\
  \ might have potential drawbacks. The complexity related to the geometries of the\
  \ model will increase while the file will become more complex as well. The main\
  \ problem is that since roads in 3D city models is a fairly new development there\
  \ are a few guidelines regarding modelling. The are many undefined concepts. With\
  \ respect to that, this Thesis aims to answer:\nWhat is the most efficient way to\
  \ model road networks and intersections in 3D semantic city models? And are the\
  \ benefits of doing this overcome the potential downsides? \nDuring this thesis,\
  \ different ideas for modelling roads will be analyzed. Areal and linear representations\
  \ of existing data of roads will be used. Making use of python programming language,\
  \ different approaches on how both these representations will be stored in a single\
  \ CityJSON file for a road city object will be explored. Modelling intersections\
  \ of roads is expected to be the most challenging part regarding modelling (Freek\
  \ Boersma 2019). The linkage of linear (MultiLineStrings) and areal (Multisurfaces)\
  \ data by one to one mapping will be tested."

- 'Polygonal meshes provide an efficient representation for 3D shapes with sparse
  sets of parameters. With the advent of deep neural networks, learning-based approaches
  for 3D reconstruction have gained popularity. However, end-to-end reconstruction
  from point clouds to polygonal meshes is still non-trivial. Existing methods either
  fail to incorporate high-level shape information, or struggle to comply with certain
  geometric constraints.


  We propose a novel framework for reconstructing compact, watertight, polygonal meshes
  from point clouds by incorporating the implicitly represented function space with
  explicitly encoded geometry. Initial results show that our method is able to reconstruct
  meshes with high geometric fidelity and error-free topology ([demo](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ez6nnmil4c0s96/sog_teaser_Fig1.avi?dl=0)).
  We hope our work, as of future iterations, can bridge the ubiquitous 3D deep learning
  solutions with more geometric constraints that are hugely neglected nowadays.'

- 'Currently, visualizing large Computation Fluid Dynamic (CFD) datasets is a rather
  difficult task to accomplish. This is because CFD outputs produce exceptionally
  large data files.

  Programs that are used to visualize data are generally not equipped to deal with
  these large datasets. Paraview is one of these possible programs, however, it can
  be slow to respond and can crash on multiple occasions due to RAM constraints. On
  the other hand, it does implement features like slicing and viewing the data at
  different time periods, which are both desired in a possible solution. Game engines
  can run 4K graphics at 60fps by optimizing their graphics rendering. I will be looking
  into these engines to see what help they can provide in increasing performance.
  However, it should be noted that these engines do not implement the above-mentioned
  features by default.

  Currently, splitting the datafiles into smaller provides one option of visualizing
  the data. However, this removes the option of viewing the entire simulation in one
  go. Some possible tactics that could be applied to increase the performance are
  loading in individual data types and reducing the number of input data points based
  on distance from the model.

  The outcome of this project should determine whether using games engines is a feasible
  option to display CFD simulation output datasets.'

  \ spatial planning approaches. While urban settings are efficiently assessed through\
  \ spatial analyses in the pre-design stage, 3D city modelling and web technologies\
  \ help to visualize and disseminate development scenarios in the post-design stage.\
  \ The intermediate stage regarding design solution and evaluation, however, hasn\u2019\

  \ The focus will be on the expansion of input KPIs, the output parameters, and the\
  \ impacts of the designs on the urban settings. To generate KPIs, a data-driven\
  \ approach that considers spatial and non-spatial, volumetric and non-volumetric\

  \ the formation and protection of coastal dunes have become a focal point for research\
  \ and development. For this reason, this Master thesis aims to investigate the impact\
  \ of certain coastal house configurations on wind turbulence for the purpose of\
  \ either heightening or widening the dunes, or even both. Computational fluid dynamics\
  \ (CFD) will be used to simulate wind around the configurations and the dunes. The\

  \ architecture PhD student from the University of Twente. Based on the initial simulations,\
  \ further configurations and parameters will be tested to optimise the results.\
  \ \nTo simulate the wind turbulence, the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)\
  \ model will be used. More specifically, simulations will be carried out using the\
  \ Re-Normalisation Group k-epsilon (RNG k-epsilon) model because it has so far been\
  \ established as the most suited to model the effects of wind turbulence in the\
  \ built environment. After running the simulations in OpenFOAM software, relevant\
  \ fields such as pressure and velocity will be analysed to filter configurations\
  \ and conclude with the best choice for the Dutch coast."

- 'The goal of this thesis project is to explore how the streaming paradigm can be
  used to create a seamless TIN of all AHN3 points in the Netherlands (~800B). The
  advantage of using a streaming Delaunay triangulation is that it circumvents having
  to load all the points into memory, which is an impossible task at this scale. However,
  a disadvantage is that this method requires an understanding of when points are
  no longer necessary for the triangulation and can be stored to disk and unloaded
  from memory. Challenges lie in determining how the point ordering of the AHN3 tiles
  will affect the efficiency of the algorithm, as well as ensuring that artefacts
  do not occur around tile borders.

  Furthermore, an assessment will be made of whether it is possible to simplify the
  triangulation at a local level. This consists of determining a (basic) methodology
  to reduce the number of triangles. This will reduce the overall size of the resulting
  triangulation, making easier to work with in subsequent research.

  The desired final result of this thesis project is to have a process in place that
  is capable of handling a large number (> 50) of AHN3 tiles and Delaunay triangulating
  them, while performing some simplification.'

- Shallow water depth information is essential for coastal management and research.
  Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) is a way to model water depth in shallow water
  areas. It can be used to fill data gaps that occur with the conventional survey
  method based on echo sounding. It is also a low-cost technique since remote sensing
  images are used instead of field surveys. The basic principle of SDB is to produce
  a continuous water depth field by finding the correlation between bottom reflectance
  from satellite images and in-situ depth acquired from conventional surveys. A major
  limitation of the SDB model is that it requires in-situ data for calibration, but
  shallow water in-situ data is not available for many areas. Most studies achieved
  a precise model by applying the model within in-situ coverage. However, it becomes
  challenging when the goal is to generate an SDB model by minimizing the amount of
  in-situ data and using the calibration model outside the input coverage. This research
  aims to investigate the possibility of machine learning to derive an SDB model with
  limited in-situ data. A machine learning method will be developed to extract depth
  in the shallow water area. The method will focus on minimizing the in-situ data
  needed for training and observing the resulting quality. The quality of the model
  will be assessed based on evaluation metrics, i.e. root mean square error and total
  vertical uncertainty.

- This thesis is about automatically reconstructing 3D buildings from historical maps.
  Current 3D city models are nowadays well-known and used for many applications, but
  historical 3D city models remain difficult to generate as they rely on various historical
  sources as historical maps and photographs. Yet historical 3D city models are valuable
  for the historical heritage as they ease the restoration of cultural sites and may
  provide worldwide access to these sites, among other applications. Some research
  has been conducted in this area, but the methods proposed to build historical 3D
  city models stay essentially manual. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is
  to automate as much as possible the whole process from the vectorization of the
  historical maps to the generation of the historical 3D city models. The first steps
  to implement are the georeferencing of the historical maps, followed by the extraction
  of the building footprints using machine learning or deep learning algorithms. A
  crude 3D city model will first be generated from the building footprints using procedural
  modelling. Building height could be extracted from historical photographs or defined
  by superimposing the current AHN3 over the building footprints. This crude 3D city
  model will then be further refined by including information from cadastral data.
  With this method, several historical 3D city models will be generated for different
  epochs, which will allow representing the evolution of a city.

  \ Point Clouds. This is a\nnon-trivial assignment as LiDAR is a light based scanning\
  \ technique. As glass is both transparent and\nreflective, light has trouble getting\
  \ a good reading of this material as it can be absorbed, pass through\nit or be\
  \ reflected by it, with only very little of the reflected light being sent back\
  \ to the scanner.\nBecause of this, points tend to show up at places where nothing\

  \ in Point Clouds showing or not showing obstacles where\nthey shouldn\u2019t or\
  \ should be.\nTo do this research is done into different types of Point Clouds to\

- "Along the Dutch coast, the dunes are the first line of defence against the sea.\
  \ To let the dunes grow along with the rising sea level, we need sediment transport\
  \ by wind. However, the growing number of beach housing on Dutch beaches effect\
  \ the wind, and therefore the sedimentation. The configurations of these buildings\
  \ can influence the amount of sediment transport along the beaches. It is interesting\
  \ therefore to explore the possibilities of configurations that could increase sediment\
  \ transport rather than limit this. Increased sedimentation can promote dune formation\
  \ and therefore aid in flood protection.\n\nThe objective of this thesis is to model\
  \ different types of beach house configurations and the effects they have on the\
  \ sediment flow considering multiple wind conditions. We aim to find if some types\

- 'Automated analysis and management of 3D city data will promote the development
  of the city, especially in large cities like Rotterdam. Therefore, this study focuses
  on the digitization and automation of the building permission checks which support
  government officials in real situations. This will follow the ambitions/specification
  of European Network for Digital Building Permits (reference: EUnet4DBP) by implementing
  simple and machine-readable rules and requirements which means we formalize and
  store the information related to the regulation in our 3D city model following a
  formal data structure (the CityGML and CityJSON ADE mechanism give inspiration for
  this part). Besides, it will ensure interoperability which allows officials to visualize
  and check the buildings follow the open standards.

  The key point of this research is to realize the interpretation and formalization
  of laws and regulations, they are then translated into algorithms for automated
  computation and analysis. The research will develop an extension of CityJSON to
  extend the existing data model since CityJSON has better interoperability than CityGML.
  We then utilize it in building permission check applications. It will store, evaluate,
  and verify the final results. This research will be carried out with a specific
  case study, by selecting a small area of the research area (Rotterdam) and specific
  laws and regulations to conduct the research, and then extend it to the realization
  of more laws and regulations.'
