    \ with the faculty of mechanical engineering of the Technical University of Munich\
    \ where a pipeline is being developed at the chair of automotive engineering to\
    \ assess the PV-potential of buildings in Bavaria. The current state includes\
    \ two Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) assessing the roof geometrical potential\
    \ for PV installation. The first network segments a roof into 16 azimuth classes;\
    \ the second detects installations on the roof, called \u201Csuperstructures\u201D\
    , as single- or multi-classes (ladder, chimney\u2026). The wider pipeline considers\
    \ the physical suitability of roofs, as well as the technical and economical potentials\
    \ for PV installation.\n \nThe motivation of the thesis is to improve the geometrical\
    \ potential assessment of roofs by extending the existing network(s) with 3D data.\
    \ Despite little research conducted on CNN for RGB-Height (Z) data, it has recently\
    \ been established that Z information added to a CNN can improve the accuracy\
    \ for classifying aerial imagery. \n\nBased on these results and the existing\
    \ work at the chair, we will explore the following question: \nHow can 3D data\
    \ be best integrated into a CNN for RGB aerial images to improve the semantic\
    \ segmentation of roof superstructures on buildings?\nVarious types of height\
    \ data and their combination with the segmentation results of the second network\
    \ will be explored, as well as their integration to the existing architecture\

- "Automated semantic segmentation\
    \ of aerial imagery is a complex problem addressed over the past years with deep\
    \ learning techniques that account for satisfactory results. However, the cost\
    \ of labeling images for deep learning-based approaches is high, and acquisition\
    \ of the labeled data is manually expensive. \n\nCurrently, in computer vision,\
    \ most research works focus more on enhancing the training data than improving\
    \ the models. One of these enhancing methods is the use of synthetic training\
    \ images, which refer to simulated aerial imagery taken from a virtual world.\
    \ Compared to real imagery data, synthetic images have several significant advantages,\
    \ such as simulating different conditions (e.g., lighting, camera positions) and\
    \ lowering production costs.\n\nConsequently, this thesis aims to create a benchmark\
    \ to produce synthetic data for aerial image segmentation. We will develop artificial\
    \ cities with procedural architecture techniques to simulate real-world cities.\
    \ We will build a tool using existing computer vision techniques to produce training\
    \ images with pixel-wise semantic segmentation. With the produced synthetic images,\
    \ we will train a deep learning model to perform semantic segmentation over real-world\
    \ images (with techniques such as domain adaptation). We will also incorporate\
    \ features of 3D building to enhance the model further. In the end, the performance\
    \ of the model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and mIoU (mean\
    \ Intersection over Union)."

    \ cross-platorm, without having to download or build anything. Secondly, client-side\
    \ geoprocessing can make geoprocessing more interactive and insightful. A 'sandbox\

    \ client-side geoprocessing. The first barrier is that the client-side programming\
    \ language `javascript`, together with its library ecosystem, do not offer the\
    \ speed nor the tools to perform fast geoprocessing. To solve this, WebAssembly,\
    \ a type of binary that runs in virtual machines, will be considered. It can be\
    \ used to take an existing C++ geoprocessing library (like _cgal_), and to publish\
    \ it in a way anyone with a browser can run it at near native speed. \n\nThe second\
    \ barrier is that an application using 'just WebAssembly' will not be very useful\
    \ or insightful without a sufficient framework supporting it. This thesis will\
    \ consider a framework in the form of a web-based Visual Programming Language,\

- 'Snap rounding (SR) is an approach
    to robust computing by converting arbitrary-precision segment arrangements into
    fixed-precision representations. A widely used implementation of it is iterated
    snap rounding (ISR). ISR guarantees that no vertices are closer with any non-incident
    edges than a threshold; therefore, it can be used to improve the robustness of
    polygons. However, it may change the topology significantly; for example, it may
    make a polygon with a hole two separate polygons. Furthermore, ISR is computationally
    expensive for big sets of polygons, like planar partitions. Recent studies on
    SR or ISR mostly focus on applications in 3D or reducing the problematic outputs
    of ISR. Few pieces of research are done on improving SR or implementing SR in
    other ways, which is essential for multiple uses. Previous work has demonstrated
    the efficiency and reliability of a constrained-triangulation-based method to
    repair a single polygon (prepair) or planar partitions (pprepair). In this project,
    we aim to build a triangulation-based snapping round method so that both the validity
    and robustness of polygons can be guaranteed.'

- 'With the continual development
    of intricate navigation tools for the everyday user (such as the ubiquitous Google
    Maps), there has been a relatively recent surge in interest for finding ways to
    unify indoor and outdoor spaces within these applications, and also for making
    the transitions between these different spaces, smoother. The difficulty often
    lies in the information on these two types of spaces being sourced and stored
    differently. And the existence of semi-indoor (top-bounded) and semi-outdoor (side-bounded)
    spaces, only serves to further complicate the matter.


    While there is valuable research on unifying these spaces and integrating different
    data types, there seems to be little focus on the users themselves. Even if seamless
    navigation is attained, it means little if the user does not understand the types
    of environment that the application is trying to convey, or cannot see what form
    of accessibility the space has. For example, a user being told that there is a
    door leading to an indoor space is of little use if that user is restricted by
    the width of a wheelchair or a pushchair, or if that door is for private use only.
    This thesis will be exploring how the transitions between (semi-) indoor-outdoor
    spaces can be intuitively visualised for clear communication to the user, with
    prototype visualisations undergoing user testing and evaluation.'

    interoperability provision in cross-border crises. Depending on the need of the
    situation, a high level of collaboration is needed, to exploit the different resources
    and model a military scene. In many cases, the military resources can be outdated

    of a military scene. An approach of a Discrete Global Grid (DGG) system could
    be applied for this purpose, also assisting on setting a model for geospatial

    can assist on modelling a military scene in one integrated way? This thesis will
    attempt to apply a DGG system and integrate different datasets (point, vector,

- "This research\
    \ project will focus on the support of the design, building permit and value assessment\
    \ process for yet to be realized buildings via the development of a software tool\
    \ that automatically detects floors, rooms and apartments from IFC models. The\
    \ major goal of this tool will be helping the user to get details about these\
    \ three building elements in a simple, quick and reliable manner so that it can\
    \ be used for not only the final assessment, but also as a quick intermediate\
    \ evaluation that can be executed during the design process. Thus, it will not\
    \ only become an assessment tool, but also a possible design tool. \nThe focus\
    \ will lie on the development of this tool to allow it to function on models that\
    \ are not optimally made. In practice used IFC models are often non-standard,\
    \ faulty or both. This could be due to (but is not limited by) the different practices\
    \ by users/firms, the different used software packages to create the models (AutoDesk\
    \ Revit, Graphisoft Archicad or IFCBlender), the fairly complex IFC standard and\
    \ normal user errors. To decrease the influence of these errors the tool will\
    \ rely minimally on the (by the user) set data fields of the present geometric\
    \ objects. Instead, it will parse the IFC model and try to generate and determine\
    \ the needed data for each of the found geometric objects itself."

- "Recent progress in computational\
    \ design of architecture have brought about a multitude of so-called \u2018test-fit\u2019\
    \ digital toolkits focused on quickly generating residential, office or other\
    \ building layouts based on a collection of user-defined parameters. However,\
    \ the designs generated often follow a single general pattern defined by the specifics\
    \ of the generative algorithm used within the tool and don\u2019t take existing\
    \ site context into consideration.\n\nThis thesis aims to investigate whether\
    \ we can build a machine learning based model for generating new building massing\
    \ designs informed by previous design solutions present within the current building\
    \ stock of the Netherlands. By defining the geometrical and semantic properties\
    \ of the desired building design and the site context it is within, we could synthesize\
    \ new design options based on similar buildings and sites already stored within\
    \ existing 3D city models."

- "Many real-world applications require\
    \ semantic-rich 3D models of urban buildings. For example, structure-aware generative\
    \ model of 3D urban geometry and texture are becoming increasingly useful in graphics\
    \ and virtual world. Labeled parts of buildings can also facilitate a variety\
    \ of analyses of buildings. However, it\u2019s challenging to obtain correct part\
    \ labels for widely available 3D models of buildings in the form of dense triangle\
    \ meshes. The annotation work is time-consuming and costly, and inexperienced\
    \ human workers can easily mislabel specific parts, such as domes or buttresses.\
    \ This thesis aims to transfer building part labels from existing CAD models of\
    \ buildings (i.e., BuildingNet) to the SUM dataset based on the theory of domain\
    \ adaptation. Our goal is to generate a part-level building segmentation dataset.\
    \ The labeled 3D building models in BuildingNet will be used as the source domain\
    \ and building models in the SUM will be the target domain. The source and target\
    \ domains all have the same feature space but different representations of geometry.\
    \ This thesis project will learn a generalized classifier in the presence of a\
    \ shift between source and target domain distributions and propose a new method\
    \ for transferring labels for 3D building models with different representations."

- "Building height plays an important role in\
    \ studying urban morphology and in applications related to the built environment.\
    \ Several remote sensing data, such as photogrammetry, high-resolution images,\
    \ airborne LiDAR data were utilized to estimate the building height. The Ice,\
    \ Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), was launched in 2018, employ\
    \ photon-counting LiDAR to collect Earth\u2019s surface elevation data globally.\
    \ Though it was designed to continuously monitor changes in polar glaciers, ice\
    \ sheets, and sea ice, the photon counting concept has been used in the applications\
    \ areas like forestry and built environment. However, the beam pairs of ICESat-2\
    \ are separated several kilometers in the cross-track direction, so it\u2019s\
    \ no complete coverage.\nThe goal of this thesis project is to retrieve building\
    \ heights from ICESat-2 and evaluate the accuracy with the data from 3D BAG. And\
    \ due to the tracks are far away with each other, the first thing needs to do\
    \ is to assess how many buildings in NL are covered. For those are uncovered,\
    \ the Machine Learning method combined with features from footprints will be used\
    \ based on previous work. These features can be classified as building geometries,\
    \ neighborhood, city types, etc. This thesis will first focus on a small area,\
    \ then extends to the whole Netherlands. Challenges lie in how to extend this\
    \ method to the entire Netherlands, the building heights data gained from ICESat-2\
    \ is insufficient compared with the prior research."

- 'Voxelised spaces have been
    used extensively for the past years to pre-process, perform

    segmentation, classification, and reconstruction of both indoor and outdoor 3D
    models of the

    built environment. In my thesis, I would further like to explore the possibility
    of using a

    semantically enriched voxelised space as a basis for evacuation management.

    The starting point for this research will be a voxelised space of a building that
    has been enriched with semantics and, more importantly, it''s known which parts
    of the building are navigable buildings and which aren''t. This voxelised space
    will most likely have to be manually edited to be able to accept input from equipment
    used in building safety management and fire suppression systems, such as smoke
    sensors and manual call points, and be able to generate output such as routes
    and signage. This leaves me with a framework in which to develop an algorithm
    that will find the best evacuation routes for all users of that building in a
    dynamic emergency situation.


    This means diving into routing/pathfinding algorithms, and applying this to the
    voxelised space. Apart from pathfinding, and the added complexity of the dynamic
    setting, I would focus on how this information is to be visualised for the users/managers
    of the building. Multiple things are possible, such as dynamic signage, using
    audio, custom evacuation plans.'

- 'Enabling collaborative
    mapping could massively reduce mapping time and improve map quality. An essential
    component of collaborative mapping is map merging, where individual local maps
    are merged into a global map. When there are large differences in quality between
    local maps traditional map merging approaches might not be possible due to deformations
    or a lack of data. In this research we will research how using derived topometric
    maps can be used to enable non-rigid map merging that can resolve inconsistencies
    between local maps.'

- 'An accurate, virtual, data-driven
    model of plant growth would enable the study and analysis of plant traits and
    behaviour in a customizable, widely applicable and non-destructive manner. However,
    estimating real-life tree growth is a difficult process due to the large number
    of factors influencing the growth process, the inherent complexity of plant growth
    and architecture, and the frequent need for prior botanical knowledge and/or accurate
    multi-temporal field data. This thesis will balance accuracy, processing speed,
    and botanical, spatial and environmental soundness to generate tree models as
    realistic as possible using synthetic multi-temporal LiDAR data of same-species
    trees. Tree growth time series will be synthesized using same-species data of
    trees at different growth stages, of which an average model will be generated
    with joint geometric and structural blending in a 3D tree shape-space per growth
    cycle. Inverse procedural modelling will be used to infer tree growth at branch
    level, taking into account detailed biological knowledge. The tree growth models
    will be validated using LiDAR time-series data and a validation algorithm measuring
    geometric, structural, and topological distance. The validated growth model will
    then be used to predict future plant growth in urban scenarios as well as interpolate
    past growth stages for which no ground-truth data exists.'
