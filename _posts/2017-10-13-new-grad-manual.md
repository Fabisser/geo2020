I was just informed by the faculty that the previous graduation manual contained two errors, these have been fixed and I've updated the document on the website:

[Official Graduation Manual 2017-2018](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/rules/GraduationManualGeomatics2017-2018.pdf)

The differences are the entry requirements for P2 and the Reflection (Appendix 3).

Notice that you have to follow the rules of the year you started your graducation work.
Even if it takes you 2 years to complete, the rules that applied when you started are the rules that apply during your whole graduation process.
