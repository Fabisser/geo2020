As mentioned in the last introduction to the MSc thesis in Geomatics, we now open the selection process for you to pick your top 3 choices.

The selection process will close on the *8th of July at 24:00*. After that moment, if you would like to select your topic you will be restricted by your peer choices, since some topics would be forever gone! 

Here you can find some links with available topics:
