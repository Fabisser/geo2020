Dear graduate students of the de Urbanism department,
 
Please hand in 1 image of your project if you graduate this June/July 2020 
for the virtual Urbanism museum 2020!

In the link you will find a form which you need to fill-in. It includes general data, possible key-words, and a request for the squared image which represents your thesis work! Very quick and easy to do!

[https://forms.gle/xWvStms6ZUzMCjrD9](https://forms.gle/xWvStms6ZUzMCjrD9)


We like to receive your material as soon as possible but certainly before 1st of July.
Noa te Duits, our student-assistant will add later (after P5) the link of the repository to your image in the exhibition!

The museum is open 24 hours and if it works will be filled year-after year! In this way your work can be seen by many people and hopefully, will attract new students and professionals who are interested in your work!
 
Kind regards, 
on behalf of all master coordinators of Urbanism
Inge Bobbink
