Monday 26 Nov 15:00-17:00

room BG.West.290

Stelios Vitalis, a PhD in the [3D geoinformation group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), will give the course.

If you can't attend, we'll make the slides available. 
You can also learn yourself, there is, for instance, [a good introduction available from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
