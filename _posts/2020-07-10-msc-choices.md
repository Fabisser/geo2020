The outcome of the MSc thesis topics is below; all of you (nearly) got their first choices so all is good I reckon.
The 2 conflicts we had have been solved.

I will get back to you in September with the official information about how to register for the P1, and there will be 1-2 lectures to help you with the research.

In the meantime, you can start--if you want--working on your thesis, ask your supervisors for material to prepare and also you can discuss with them which elective courses would be best for your topic.

Enjoy the summer ‚òÄÔ∏èüèñ
