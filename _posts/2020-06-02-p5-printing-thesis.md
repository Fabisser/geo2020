**This message is for those who just passed P4**

While the graduation manual states that:

> Deliver a printed copy of the final thesis to all mentors, the Delegate of the Board of Examiners and the Director of Education at latest one week before P5.

This is not possible and thus does not need to be done. 
You do need to send a PDF to all members of the committee (and CC `afstuderen-bk@tudelft.nl`); you should include the co-reader, even though that person is not required to attend the P5.

And when you upload the final thesis to the repository, send the link to the Director of Education (Bastiaan van Loenen <B.vanLoenen@tudelft.nl>).
