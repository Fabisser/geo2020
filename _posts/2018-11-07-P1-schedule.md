*update 2018-11-08*: room for Nov14 has changed to "room F"

I bundled people by supervisors and requests I got by email; I did my best.

Students need to attend both days, unless they tell me beforehand why they cannot attend (another course is more or less the only reason acceptable).

As you see, the schedule is tight, and therefore 10min will be 10min.

Best is if you bring a USB with your PDF (or PPT) and you use the room computer. Upload your presentation during the break.
