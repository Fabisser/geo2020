- Wednesday 28 April 2021
- 10:00--11:30

Iâ€™ll give an overview of the graduation process, explain how to find a topic and two supervisors, what the milestones are, and how to get a high final mark (!).

All details are on the website: https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/

It's a mandatory session if you want to start the process in September.

It'll be on ZOOM: https://tudelft.zoom.us/j/93211774504?pwd=RGVsc2lPMXVGbUx1cUViYzhoUER3Zz09
