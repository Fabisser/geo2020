The P1s are planned over 2 days:

  - __P1 (day1)__, 14 Nov 2018, 08:45 - 11:30, BK room K

  - __P1 (day2)__, 15 Nov 2018, 08:45 - 11:30, BK room P


As soon as I know who-is-doing-what-supervised-by-who, then I'll make a schedule and bundle students with the same 1st supervisor together.
As a reminder, you [register for P1 here](https://hugol.typeform.com/to/hve5tZ).


As a students, it is mandatory to attend all P1s, not only yours.
