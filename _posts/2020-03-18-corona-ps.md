I got some update from the faculty concerning the Ps.

  1. All Ps will be held at the date/time agreed, but online. The communication tool used is officially the choice of the 1st supervisor, although the slides need to be shared and a discussion should be held. I suggest https://discordapp.com, it's free, works well, and it's for all platform. Skype and Zoom are alternatives.
  2. the 1st supervisor needs to arrange the logistics and contact the chairperson.
  3. The deadline for applying for the P4 period in May 2020 is 9 April. Due to the corona virus, the BK-admin would like to receive all P4 forms digitally. The students are not allowed to come to the faculty to bring the P4 application form. 
  4. The [P4 application form](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/Studentenportal/Faculteitspecifiek/Bouwkunde/Studie-%20%26%20Loopbaan/Forms/Master%20of%20Science%20Geomatics/Geomatics_Application_form_for_the_go_01.pdf) can be signed digitally by the staff (Adobe and Preview.app have that built-in). If impossible, then the supervisor has to send an email to the student and CC `afstuderen-bk@tudelft.nl` stating that they will attend.
  5. if you're not sure if you can make it for the P4, it's fine to register and cancel later. If you don't register then you for sure cannot do it.
