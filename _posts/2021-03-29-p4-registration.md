Just a kind reminder that the deadline to register for the next P4 is 9 April 2021, and that your P3 should be done before that date.

__P3__: you plan it yourself, and your main supervisor just has to tick the box in the SharePoint system. The admin is not involved.

__P4__: there's a form to fill out to register, it's [there](https://d2k0ddhflgrk1i.cloudfront.net/Studentenportal/Faculteitspecifiek/Bouwkunde/Studie-%20%26%20Loopbaan/Forms/Master%20of%20Science%20Geomatics/Geomatics%20Application%20form%20for%20the%20go.pdf) 

Also, read [this about the P4](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/rules/#p4).
