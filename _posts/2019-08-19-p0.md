The official introduction to GEO2010/GEO2020 will be:

  - Friday 13 September 2019
  - 10:00-12:00
  - BK room R

I have already gave you an overview of the graduation process (before the summer), so here we will:

- Discuss the exact timeline and how to register for P1/P2/etc.
- I'll answer any questions you have
- Have an intro about reproducibility in science
- Have presentations, from some Geomatics staff, of potential topics. As a reminder, we maintain [a list of topics](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/potentialtopics/).


See you there,
Hugo
