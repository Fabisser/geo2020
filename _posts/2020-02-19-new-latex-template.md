The [LaTeX template for the P4/P5](https://github.com/tudelft3d/msc_geomatics_thesis_template) has been updated: new versions of LaTeX compilers were giving a lot of warnings (on Windows I heard) and I tried to fix them but it wasn't clear what were the problems.

So I simplified it and it now uses "standard" fonts and doesn't throw any warnings (at least for me! let me know if it does for you).

You just need to download the folder, replace your chapters and update the `mysettings.tex` file a bit, and voil√† you're good.

It's not mandatory to use this template, you use what you want (including Word).

The Appendix of the template contains what we would like you to do for reproducibility of science: rate yourself on 5 criteria and write a one-page reflection.
Mandatory it is not, speak to your supervisors about it.
