The evaluation criteria that will be used by the committee to mark the final thesis, also called a rubric, are available in the Appendix 1 of the Graduation Manual.

However, for P5, we now have a new and (much) improved version that makes it better and clearer. 
From now one, this is what will be used to mark all graduation theses in Geomatics.
You can [download it here](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/rules/Rubric_Geomatics_2017-04-12.xlsx).
