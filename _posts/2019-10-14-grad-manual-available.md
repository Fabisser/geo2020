The [graduation manual 2019-2020]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/rules/#the-official-graduation-material) is finally available.

Read it, twice.

For those who have already read last year version, the changes are minimal:

  1. the P2 Word template has been replaced by a LaTeX one
  2. the order of staff asking questions at P2/P4/P5 has been clarified.

The rubric for marking the final thesis is in Appendix 5 but is barely readable, get [PDF version]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/rubric) instead.

Also, don't forget that the deadline to [register for P1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/rules/#p1/) is 4 November 2019.
