Some of you have asked to have more details concerning the P1.
So here they are:

  - nothing to formally submit, but you should have discussed with your mentors the *draft* project proposal, and thus know what your title, research objectives and problematic are.
  - you give a 10min presentation about these, and the feedback you get is used to write the full P2 project proposal.

I have put [more details concerning the P2 graduation plan](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/templates/), along with one good example from last year. 
Your mentors are in charge of helping you write it, and will give you more details and help.
If something is not clear, please let me know.

Hope this helps.
