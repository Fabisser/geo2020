For those who haven't submitted yet their thesis to the TUD repository, we would like to remind you about the statement you have to add to the appendix to describe the level of reproducibility of your thesis (self-assessment).

Details are in the [LaTex file of the thesis template](https://github.com/tudelft3d/msc_geomatics_thesis_template/blob/master/appendices/reproducibility.tex).

And if you could, after having submitted your thesis, please spend ~5min to answer this post-experiment questionnaire: [https://forms.gle/KCD5Ym4VJRmZzZqNA](https://forms.gle/KCD5Ym4VJRmZzZqNA)
Some of you have not yet filled the first questionnaire, you can still do it here: [https://forms.gle/BTmPc5ExhEJNkUtFA](https://forms.gle/BTmPc5ExhEJNkUtFA)

Thank you all for your participation in this self-assessment experiment!

Best regards,
Rusne & Hugo
