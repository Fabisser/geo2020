For those ones that did not select a topic in June and want to select a topic, please feel free to check the resources of topics from the different teachers and approach them if interested. We won't do a second selection online round. 

This Friday at 2pm in BG West 670 I will have an intro thesis class for those ones that still have doubts about how the MSc thesis work and which are the steps that need to be completed.

I hope to see some of you there! =)
