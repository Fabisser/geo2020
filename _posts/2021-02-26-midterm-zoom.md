For those reaching the midterm of their graduation project, I propose that you give a presentation not only for your supervisors, but also for other students and staff that are interested.

This is not mandatory, but I think this is nice.

I don't want to enforce specific dates, but somewhere around mid-March should be good.

After agreeing on a timeslot, fill out [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eHFHEhphWIU3XeQYkEiHoR__U-eS9h1NwMqs9W1mZSA/edit?usp=sharing), and hopefully many attend and ask questions.

Sessions should be 30min total: 15-20min presentation + questions.

Cheers,
Hugo
