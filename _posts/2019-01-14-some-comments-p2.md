1. you have 15min to setup your computer since all the P2 start at XX:00. This might sound long, but in some rooms the projectors are locked and there are no cables. As a student, it is *your* responsibility to go get the key/cable (at the Service Point in the main entrance, simply ask for the key of your room) and to bring it back afterwards.
2. P2 is an open session, so your friends or anyone can attend.

Good luck,
Hugo
