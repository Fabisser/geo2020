Some of you asked questions about the P2, here are some clarifications:

  - the central administration is the one scheduling your P2, your supervisors and myself do not decide. Most of them will be January 16--18. When the scheduling is done (I don't know when that will be), it will appear in your personal calendar.
  - you need to write a full proposal, there is a [template on the website](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/templates/). The form from the graduation manual should be used for your name, contact and title. The rest you can write: "refer to full P2 proposal".
  - take into account that you need to submit your P2 one week before your P2.
