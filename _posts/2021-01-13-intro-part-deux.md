For the few starting GEO2010/GEO2020 this coming Q3, there will be a short intro to answer your questions:

- Thursday 2021-02-11 @ 10:00-11:00
- on ZOOM: https://tudelft.zoom.us/j/93731971439?pwd=OUJWS3VWekxkT1lEQ09YcmlqZ2ZhUT09

I'll explain how it works for you.

It would be nice if you first watched the [last general introduction I gave](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/uEigHgL5HJnyVbE) with all the tips, this was given in May 2020 and I reckon many of you attended. [The full slides](https://speakerdeck.com/hugoledoux/intro-to-geo2020) are available also.

Watch out though the Ps have been simplified, and I will explain on Feb11 the new setup.
