I got a few questions from some of you concerning P4, so here are some answers:

  - the deadline to apply is 2018-04-20
  - you do this by filing out [this form](https://d1rkab7tlqy5f1.cloudfront.net/Studentenportal/Faculteitspecifiek/Bouwkunde/Studie-%20%26%20Loopbaan/Forms/Master%20of%20Science%20Geomatics/Geomatics_Application_form_for_the_go_01.pdf)
  - WATCH OUT: you need several signatures, don't start 1h before.
  - Pro-tip: don't print it, instead ask people to digitally sign it with the PDF reader (Adobe and Preview.app have that built-in)
  - the '3rd mentor' is the co-reader, you and your supervisor have to pick one. The rules are explained in the Graduation Manual
  - your P4 will held during that period: 2018-05-22 --> 2018-05-31
  - you don't choose the exact date, although you can propose it. The central administration does.
  - the *full draft* of your thesis needs to be handed in one week before your P4. Full draft means [this](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo2020/faq/#what-is-a-complete-draft-at-p4)
  - if you can't make it, then the following period for P4 will be at the end of September 2018.
  - P4 is a go/nogo, thus what you submit is assessed.
  - if unsure if you can make, better to register and then cancel later in May.
